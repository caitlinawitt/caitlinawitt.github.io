      <description>The Pulsar Signal Simulator is an incredibly useful tool made by a group of amazing NANOGrav scientists. The software is designed as an tool that can realistically replicate the signals produced by pulsars, from the time of emission until they are observed by the telescope. In addition to being a useful educational device for students new to the world of pulsars, the package is critical to testing pipelines that handle our real data analysis.</description>
